# Knowledge Graph Evolution

## Definition
Knowledge graphs have evolved from early semantic networks into sophisticated knowledge management systems integrated with AI capabilities.

## Key Points
- Emerged from semantic networks, frames, and expert systems
- Standardized through Semantic Web technologies (RDF, OWL)
- Popularized by Google's Knowledge Graph in 2012
- Expanded to enterprise and domain-specific applications
- Now integrating with machine learning and neural approaches
