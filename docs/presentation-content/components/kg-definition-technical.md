# Knowledge Graph Technical Definition

## Definition
A knowledge graph is a labeled, directed multigraph composed of heterogeneous entities, relationship types, and property assertions, based on formal descriptive semantics with inferential capabilities that enable reasoning over the graph structure.

## Key Points
- Implements RDF (Resource Description Framework) data model: subject-predicate-object triples
- Utilizes formal ontologies (e.g., OWL) to define semantic constraints
- Supports SPARQL or Cypher-based graph query languages
- Provides inference through description logics and rule systems
- Offers connectivity to external systems via standard APIs
- Enables probabilistic reasoning through confidence values and uncertainty measures

## Focus Entities
- inference
- semantic
- query

## Presenter Notes
This technical definition emphasizes the formal aspects of knowledge graphs, highlighting the mathematical structures, inferential capabilities, and standards-compliance. For technical audiences, mention the distinctions between property graphs and RDF graphs, and how modern knowledge graphs often blend elements of both approaches.
