# Knowledge Graph Introduction

This presentation introduces the fundamentals of knowledge graphs, their structure, applications, and implementation approaches.

## What is a Knowledge Graph?

**Definition**: A structured representation of knowledge as a network of entities and relationships

**Key Concept**: Focus on connections and context rather than isolated data points

* Entities represent real-world objects, concepts, or events
* Relationships connect entities and provide context
* Properties add additional attributes to entities and relationships

### Conceptual Structure

A knowledge graph can be understood as a connected network of information:

```graph
[Person]-has->[Name]
[Person]-works_at->[Organization]
[Organization]-located_in->[City]
[City]-part_of->[Country]
[Person]-knows->[Person]
```

### Real-World Example

Consider this simple knowledge graph about technology companies:

```ascii
+----------+       +----------------+        +----------+
| Apple    |------>| Cupertino      |------->| USA      |
+----------+       +----------------+        +----------+
     |                                            ^
     |                                            |
     v                                            |
+----------+       +----------------+             |
| Tim Cook |------>| CEO            |             |
+----------+       +----------------+             |
                                                  |
                                                  |
+----------+       +----------------+             |
| Microsoft|------>| Redmond        |-------------+
+----------+       +----------------+
     |
     |
     v
+----------+       +----------------+
| Satya N. |------>| CEO            |
+----------+       +----------------+
```

## Knowledge Graph Evolution Timeline

Knowledge graphs have evolved significantly over time.

### From Semantic Networks to Modern KGs

```ascii
+-------------------+     +---------------------+     +--------------------------------+
| 1960s-1980s       |     | 1990s-2012          |     | 2013-Present                   |
| Early Knowledge   |     | Semantic Web &      |     | Modern Knowledge Graph Era     |
| Representation    |     | First KGs           |     |                                |

```

## Core Components

Knowledge graphs are built on several key components that enable their functionality and power.

### Entities

Entities represent objects, concepts, or events in the real world:

* People (e.g., Tim Cook, Ada Lovelace)
* Organizations (e.g., Apple, MIT)
* Places (e.g., San Francisco, Mount Everest)
* Concepts (e.g., Artificial Intelligence, Democracy)
* Products (e.g., iPhone, Tesla Model 3)
* Events (e.g., World War II, Olympic Games)

### Relationships

Relationships connect entities and provide semantic meaning:

* Hierarchical (isA, partOf)
* Temporal (before, after, during)
* Spatial (locatedIn, adjacentTo)
* Social (knows, follows, employs)
* Functional (creates, uses, affects)

### Properties

Properties add attributes to entities and relationships:

* Name, identifier, description
* Quantitative measures (age, weight, price)
* Qualitative attributes (color, status, category)
* Temporal properties (creation date, validity period)

## Data Models

Let's compare different data models for storing and representing knowledge.

### Comparison of Data Models

| Model | Structure | Schema | Query Language | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-------|-----------|--------|---------------|-----------|------------|
| Relational | Tables | Fixed | SQL | Mature, ACID | Schema rigidity |
| Graph | Nodes & Edges | Flexible | Cypher, SPARQL | Relationship traversal | Less standardized |
| Document | Nested docs | Schema-free | JSON path | Flexible schema | Limited relationships |
| Key-Value | Key-value pairs | None | Key lookup | Simple, fast | Limited query capability |

## Implementation Process

Implementing a knowledge graph involves several key steps.

### Implementation Flow

```flow
Data Sources => Data Integration => Knowledge Extraction => Knowledge Representation => Schema/Ontology => Storage => Query & Inference => Applications
```

### Knowledge Graph Construction

1. **Identify Data Sources**
   * Internal structured data (databases, APIs)
   * External knowledge bases (Wikidata, DBpedia)
   * Unstructured text (documents, web pages)

2. **Define Schema/Ontology**
   * Entity types and hierarchies
   * Relationship types and constraints
   * Property definitions

3. **Extract & Transform**
   * Entity extraction from text
   * Relationship identification
   * Integration of structured data

4. **Storage & Management**
   * Graph databases (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune)
   * Triple stores (GraphDB, Stardog)
   * Custom solutions (embeddings + vector DB)

## Applications

Knowledge graphs power a wide range of applications across industries.

### Enterprise Applications

* **Semantic Search**
  * Enhanced information retrieval
  * Question answering systems
  * Contextual recommendations

* **Data Integration**
  * Master data management
  * Data catalogs & lineage
  * 360Â° customer/product view

* **Decision Support**
  * Risk assessment
  * Fraud detection
  * Research assistance

### Industry Examples

| Industry | Application | Benefits |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Healthcare | Patient records integration, clinical decision support | Better diagnosis, personalized treatment |
| Finance | Fraud detection, risk assessment, compliance | Reduced fraud, improved compliance |
| E-commerce | Product recommendations, supply chain optimization | Increased sales, efficiency |
| Manufacturing | Digital twins, supply chain optimization | Process improvement, cost reduction |
