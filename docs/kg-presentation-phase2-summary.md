## Technical Implementation Details

### Module Structure

Each slide module follows a consistent pattern:

```typescript
/**
 * Module Slides Module
 * Defines slides covering [topic] for knowledge graphs
 */
import { SlideConfig, SlideGroup } from '../types/slide-data';
import { GraphData } from '../types/graph-data';

/**
 * Example data structures
 */
const exampleData = {
  // Data definitions for visualizations
};

/**
 * Individual Slide configurations
 */
const exampleSlide: SlideConfig = {
  id: 'slide-unique-id',
  title: 'Slide Title',
  content: {
    definition: 'Main concept definition...',
    keyPoints: [ /* Key points as array */ ],
    // Optional content components
    codeSnippets: [ /* Code examples */ ],
    listItems: [ /* Structured lists */ ]
  },
  visualizationType: 'graph', // or 'table', 'flowDiagram', etc.
  visualizationConfig: {
    // Visualization-specific configuration
  },
  transition: 'slide',
  notes: 'Speaker notes with additional context'
};

/**
 * Module slide group configuration 
 */
export const moduleSlideGroup: SlideGroup = {
  title: 'Module Section Title',
  id: 'module-id',
  includeSectionSlide: true,
  slides: [
    // Array of slide configurations
  ]
};

/**
 * Module slides export
 */
export const moduleSlides = moduleSlideGroup.slides;
```

This consistent structure ensures maintainability and facilitates future extensions.
