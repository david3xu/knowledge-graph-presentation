## Module Architecture Structure

Each module follows the template-based architecture with four key components:

1. **Data Transformer** (`data.ts`):
   - Implements domain-specific content extraction logic
   - Converts raw content into visualization-compatible data structures
   - Handles error boundaries and content normalization

2. **Configuration Factory** (`config.ts`):
   - Generates visualization parameters with appropriate defaults
   - Implements domain-specific visualization configuration
   - Provides styling, layout, and interaction parameters

3. **Slide Factory** (`slides.ts`):
   - Creates slide configurations with domain-specific content
   - Implements specialized slide types for the domain
   - Handles content formatting and organization

4. **Module Orchestration** (`index.ts`):
   - Coordinates components through dependency injection
   - Implements domain-specific module options
   - Provides backward-compatible factory functions
