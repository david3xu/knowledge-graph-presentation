# Knowledge Graph: Technical Architecture and Implementation

## Slide 1: Introduction to Knowledge Graphs

**Definition**: A knowledge graph is a structured representation of information that models real-world entities and their relationships in a graph format.

## Slide 2: Core Components

Knowledge graphs consist of three fundamental elements:

1. **Entities (Nodes)**: Objects, concepts, or events with unique identities
2. **Relationships (Edges)**: Directed, typed connections between entities
3. **Properties (Attributes)**: Key-value pairs that describe characteristics of entities and relationships
